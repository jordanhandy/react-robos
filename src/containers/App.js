// Basic construct of State in react
// Your App extends the Component class

// Use a constructor do declare the state.
// Within the state object, you define the items
// that can change as a part of state

// In this case, it is the robots data file, and the
// search field acting on that data file
class App extends Component {
  // call the base class
  // call super
  constructor() {
    super();
    // define the 'state' object
    this.state = {
      robots: [],
      searchfield: "",
    };
  }
  // use React lifecycle method to call componentDidMount() and create a GET
  // request to an API endpoint.  This endpoint holds the data we need, so the static
  // robots.txt data file is not needed

  // JSON-formatted response is returned, then this is set as the new state of the 'robots' prop
  componentDidMount() {
    fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users")

  // the function action on state.
  // You need to use the functionName = (params) => { syntax so that when you call 'this', the app
  // knows that you are referring to the parent, and not the event in question, sent as params

    // set the state of the searchfield to equal that of the value being typed into the searchfield
